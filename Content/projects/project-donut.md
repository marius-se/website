My biggest learning at Donut: How to use Zoom and other video-conferencing tools *#Covid19*. No seriously. I learned how to work in a bigger team, take full-responsibilty on certain tasks and jump between two development teams, while sitting at home because of the Corona pandemic.

Besides working on the feed and profile screens I spend some time on the video editor side digging deep into AVFoundation. I've build a custom [benchmark tool](https://github.com/marius-se/bufferingtestapp) to analyze how the build-in buffering from AVFoundation works before I implemented an advanced caching service for the feed screen.
