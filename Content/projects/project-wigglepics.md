Wigglepics Events is a tool to send selected photos via email. Imagine being a guest at a big event. You go to a photographer, the photographer takes photos from you and you can immediately send yourself these photos. The peculiarity is that those images are rather a video than a static image. "They are wiggling from left to right". Learn more about Wigglepics here: [@wigglepics](https://www.instagram.com/wigglepics/)

Wigglepics Events was my very first project as a Freelancer.
I've completely build this app on my own: From scratch to 100% done.
