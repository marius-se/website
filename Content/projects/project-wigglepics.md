How does an event photographer distribute photos to guests as efficiently as possible?

"Wigglepics" aren't just photos, but videos with a Matrix like bullet time effect. "They are wiggling from left to right".

A backend server, an iPad app and a command line tool. 100% Swift. By choosing a Swift-only stack I was able to reuse a lot of code while keeping up the maintainability and readability for future development.
