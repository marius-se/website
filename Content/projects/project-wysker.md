Wysker *was* an Instagram-like app to discover the freshest goods from all over the web faster than ever before. The app allows you to tap through a constant stream of stories created by brands, influencers or your friends. You can follow your friends, see what they like and react to products. I joined this startup as a Junior iOS Developer. Besides from doing tons of UI adjustments I implemented a pinch to zoom feature, extended the comment section with a complex tag-a-friend system and applied a muffling effect to the background music when commenting.

*Keywords: UIKit, AVFoundation*

Unfortunately, the startup went bankrupt so I had to leave the company. They already shut down the server and I do not know how long the app will be available in the AppStore :-(
