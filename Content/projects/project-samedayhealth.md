To actively fight the COVID-19 pandemic I joined Sameday Health as a contractor leading the development of their iOS app - enabling thousands of US citizens to book COVID-19 testing and vaccination appointments through a native iOS app.

With tens of thousands 5 star app reviews (4.9 stars in total) my work played an important role for the company's success.
