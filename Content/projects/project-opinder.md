Opinder is a project we started at university. It's a survey tool for companies or big institutions to collect quantitative feedback from their workers/ students etc. ... It works similarly like Tinder: Swipe right to agree with a certain opinion, left to disagree and up if you don't know. The goal is to increase the number of people participating in surveys by making it more fun and interactive than Google Forms or Doodle.

As the head of development in our team I've not only build the app 100% from scratch but also developed the idea and a strong team.
